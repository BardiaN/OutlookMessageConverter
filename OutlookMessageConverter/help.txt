Welcome to the outlook message converter!
+ You can start the process using one of these steps:
- Drag your Outlook message(s) directly from the Outlook!
Or
- Drag your saved Outlook message(s) from your hard drive (.msg file(s))
Or
- Import your .msg file(s) using the "File > Import From File" menu

+ You can change the order of dropped messages using up and down keys in left side of the tree view.
+ You added a message by mistake? No problem at all, just select the message node in the tree view, then press "Delete" button on your keyboard or select the "Tree View > Delete Node" menu.
+ You can use "Tree View > Expand All/Collapse All" to view your message nodes better, before you export them into the PDF file.
+ Finally, just click the export button and save your PDF!

* There are some tweaks to make your experience better:
- Always on top: It could help keep your application on top of every other window, so you can easily drag and drop your messages from Outlook
- Show confirm on delete: If you need a confirmation before deleting every tree node, you can set this on. (helps to prevent deleting by mistake)
- Adding messages when tree is not empty: When your tree has already some messages and you drag some new messages, you have 3 options:
	- Ask you everytime
	- Append new messages
	- Overwrite messages
